**Description** 
This project is a desktop widget that allows the user to set timers. The user can set the widget to either appear on-hover (appears in the top-left of the screen when a desktop cursor is hovered over its location, and disappears when the cursor is not present there) 
or open and close it via the keybind "Alt-W". The user can also customize the volume of the timer and choose from three different alarm noises.
