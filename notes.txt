functioning of app:

loop shows window
clicking button leads to header function
function runs and completes task,
if function needs to run over a set amount of time (such as a timer), it must run alongside the main loop
? How to make the function run alongside the main loop? Can it be done in a modular manner?
solution 1: main loop has if statement checks that will run different states based on what functions are running (just as in Shooter Game)

Current issues: 
Options button opens timer prompt?
When hovering over prompt window there is some awkward flickering
Settings prompt is nowhere to be seen, not attached to any button
